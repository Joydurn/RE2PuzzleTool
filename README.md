# RE2PuzzleTool
Tool for speedrunners

Gamer time

Solve the puzzles as fast as you can, matching the 3 dials to the solution.

        Everytime you load, the starting position is randomised.

        Controls:

        W and S to go up and down the dial

        A and D to switch dials

        Q,E or F to complete puzzle

        R to restart

        P to clear PB

       

        Other notes:

        Tried to account for input delay when going up/down dials:

        if down/up inputs are less than about 160ms apart, error will be displayed

        when trying to complete the puzzle. This is to try to simualate how the game

        can drop inputs if you spam too fast, definitely not accurate though.

       

        Game/tool is based on Resident Evil 2 Remake's medallion puzzles to help speedrunners

        Actual puzzles made by CAPCOM Kappa
